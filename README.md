## Setting Up the Selenium Environment

To use Selenium with `pytest`, follow the steps below to set up the environment.

### Step 1: Install WebDriver

Download browser-specific drivers: 
1. **Chrome**: You can download ChromeDriver from [(https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/download/)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads)
2. **Firefox**: You can download  from ([https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/download/](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases))

### Step 2: Install Required Python Packages

To install Selenium and pytest, open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install selenium pytest

```

## Running Tests with pytest 
Write the test scripts, then run the script by opening the terminal and run:

```bash
pytest test_login.py 
```
With test_login.py is a name of test file

To get even more detailed output, use the -v flag:

```bash
pytest -v test_login.py
```

For a more visual representation of the test results, you can generate HTML reports using the pytest-html plugin.

1. **Install pytest-html**
```bash
pip install pytest-html
```
2. **Run tests with HTML report generation**
```bash
pytest --html=report.html
```
The report.html file will be saved in the same directory as the test file
